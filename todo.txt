		process to get all stuff to appear

turn off trunk links and trunk import script

have manual links to tsx files

npm run build:vite

add back links and script

delete manual links

make sure the js files in the vite assest output folder are is jsdist/js

npm run build:trunk 
npm run generate
npm run serve

todo:

define a script that will take in a single index.html with special comments,
and replace them with two generated versions for the build process

figure out how to point vite and trunk at the correct stuff

then:

concurrently {
	watchexec {
		npm run clean,
		npm run build:vite,
		npm run build:trunk,
		npm run generate,
	},
	npm run serve
}


This is getting pretty complex, bound to be slow
Going to be a 10 sec hot reload, lol
